# Hammer vs Mallet

- A mallet is made of one head, usually of wood or rubber
- They are used to hit softer
- A hammer is made generally of metal
- They are used to hit things like nails

# Flux

![[media/S.10.JaM. - Flux.jpeg]]

- Flux: “a compound, often made with borax,  which is applied onto a joint before soldering to prevent oxides. Using flux keeps your piece clean, allowing the solder to flow easily once brought up to temperature.”

# Annealing

- Annealing: The process of making a metal softer and easier to work with

Annealing vs Melting temperatures:

| Material             | Annealing temperature (°F) | Melting temperature (°F) |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Brass                | 800-1300                   | 1830                     |
| Copper               | 1110-1290                  | 1980                     |
| Nickel               | 1300-2200                  | 2650                     |
| Sterling Silver      | 1100-1200                  | 1640                     |
| Hard Silver Solder   | n/a                        | 1365                     |
| Medium Silver Solder | n/a                        | 1275                     |
| Easy Silver Solder   | n/a                        | 1145                     |
