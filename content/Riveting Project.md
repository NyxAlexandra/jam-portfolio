## Artist Statement

I was very low on ideas for this one. I saw the wires and though t that they could be used as an axel. Maybe I should have realized that it was a bad ideas sooner.

## Log

The design I chose.

Holes drilled. I messed up one of the holes on the gears when the drill slipped. it was therefore unable to rotate around it's center.

I spent a long time trying to get the gears to fully rotate.
