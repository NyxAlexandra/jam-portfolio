## Artist Inspirations

I had difficulty choosing what to create. I didn't have any good ideas, and the ones I did have didn't work out (see the rings on the right side of the sketch). This was probably my least favorite project, both because I didn't like how my pieces turned out, and that drawing and sawing are the techniques I am least skilled in.

## Log

My initial ideas included a cat and the letter 'H'. I found that the cat was too complicated. I then though of printing out designs to trace over, whjich I ended up going with.

I traced the designs I printed out. I ended up not doing the design in green, as it was complicated. Here you can see that I was experimenting with flower designs for what would go in that bottom right corner.

Here, I finished tracing most of the designs. Here is where I realised that my tracing paper was not the same size as the sheet of aluminum as I had forgotten to trace it.

I fixed the size of the tracing paper and glued it on. The Spotify code could not be scanned, sadly.

I started cutting out the pieces.

Mostly done with the sawing.

All sawing is done.

I work on filing.

I stamp the Spotify code and work more on filing.

Filing is complete for the code and the snowflake. I also punched out and drilled holes for the designs that needed them.

All filing is complete. Sanding is finished for the Spotify code.

The ‘H’ and the ‘E’ are finished. All are finished sanding.
