I didn't have any good ideas, and the ones I did have didn't work out (see the rings on the right side of the sketch). This was probably my least favorite project, both because I didn't like how my pieces turned out, and that drawing and sawing are the techniques I am least skilled in.\n\n## Log\n\nMy initial ideas included a cat and the letter 'H'. I found that the cat was too complicated. I then though of printing out designs to trace over, whjich I ended up going with.\n\n![65C19E44-172B-4DBF-8FA0-E57FFCCEAD44.jpeg](media/65C19E44-172B-4DBF-8FA0-E57FFCCEAD44.jpeg)                                 \n\nI traced the designs I printed out. I ended up not doing the design in green, as it was complicated. Here you can see that I was experimenting with flower designs for what would go in that bottom right corner.\n\n![9614AA35-C54F-4E8B-A31F-D64E16A30035](media/9614AA35-C54F-4E8B-A31F-D64E16A30035.jpeg)                                                                                              \n\nHere, I finished tracing most of the designs. Here is where I realised that my tracing paper was not the same size as the sheet of aluminum as I had forgotten to trace it.\n\n![40AA079C-88DF-425A-866D-9A2DD4A97208](media/40AA079C-88DF-425A-866D-9A2DD4A97208.jpeg)                                                                                                                                               \n\nI fixed the size of the tracing paper and glued it on.

Even so, I think these came out good.\n\n[[Wire Project]]\n\nMy first idea. 2 22 gauge copper wires were threaded through each bead. Then, a latch was created, which was attached to the other side.\n\n![testsesets.jpg](media/testsesets.jpeg)\n\n![Wire Project - Latch Bracelet (2)](media/Latch%20Bracelet%202.jpeg)\n\nA simple ring. Made from 3 22 gauge wires twisted using a drill. The ends were soldered together at the end.\n\n![S.10.JaM. - Wire Project - Coil Ring](media/S.10.JaM.%20-%20Wire%20Project%20-%20Coil%20Ring.jpg)\n\nA keychain made from the leftover wire from the ring. The decoration at the bottom was from the scrap bin. The decoration was threaded onto one of the wires, which was then tied. The top was soldered to itself, then attached to a key ring.\n\n![S.10.JaM. - Wire Project - Keychain](media/S.10.JaM.%20-%20Wire%20Project%20-%20Keychain.jpg)\n\n## Riveting Project\n\nit took a while to find what I wanted to create. My idea was 2 gears that could rotate around each other, however many things went wrong. My sawing was poor, and They didn't rotate at all.\n\n![S.10.JaM. - Riveting Project - Final Photo](media/S.10.JaM.%20-%20Riveting%20Project%20-%20Final%20Photo.jpeg)\n\n[Riveting Project](Riveting%20Project.md)\n\n## Sweat Soldering Project\n\nOverall, this project was one of the easier ones. The sawing was easy (though I managed to mess it up for the gold layer), and it came together well.

The most difficult part was getting it to wrap around the ball. The read ribbon is meant to be a collar, but it serves a dual purpose of hiding the mess up mouth stamp.\n\n![EEAEEBAA-9C2E-4F63-9F54-2AC845F3C639](media/EEAEEBAA-9C2E-4F63-9F54-2AC845F3C639.jpeg)\n\n[Combo Project](Combo%20Project.md)","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T16:56:08.854558024Z","tags":null},"/Riveting-Project":{"title":"Riveting Project","content":"\n## Artist Statement\n\nI was very low on ideas for this one.
